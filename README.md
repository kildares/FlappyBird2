# FlappyBird2
This is a personal project which replicates the Flappy Bird game. 
The development of this game has been done by using the game libray LIBGDX.
In the game you have to accumulate points by going through the pipes. The more pipes you go through, the more points you get. 
The source code is pretty straightforward, it intantiates pipes and the bird objects and checks if the bird has collided with any pipes. 
Also, it is necessary for the user to tap the screen in order to avoid the bird of falling. All of this is basically in a loop.
Polishments have been made to make the screen adequate to as many smartphones/tablets as possible. 
The API provided by LIBGDX makes it possible to easily perform collision detection, which is the greatest challenge of this game.
